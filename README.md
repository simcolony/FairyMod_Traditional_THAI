FairyMod Traditional THAI

Thank you so much to have downloaded my first mod! In this document I'll say what are the characteristics of the mod.
                                             -First of all: Fairies!-
Yes, you can now control a new occult, that is the fairy life state. Fairies have some changes and bonuses:
- They have a higher pitch voice than the other sims.
- They have a pair of wings and pointy ears! (NOTE: You can't wear hats nor glasses as a fairy. Sorry...)
- They have 1 new interaction, that is "I Can Fly!" (From the Sims 3 Supernatural) where they'll fly around increasing
the fun need.
- Most of the time, they won't walk, but fly! (NOTE: They will walk when feeling bored, unconfortable and energic. 
They will also walk if they have a custom walkstyle! So make sure to give them the default walkstyle in order to fly!)
- They will perform a special idle animation from time to time.
- Their fun and social will drop slightly faster than normal
- The Mischief skill now develops MUCH faster! Fairies are really mischievous!
- They will occasionally have two buffs: 
= "Feeling Playful" (+3 playful)
= "Where's the fun?!?" (+4 Bored)
- Children, Childish and Insane sims will continuously react when they see a fairy receiving the "Wow! A Fairy!" (+6 happy) Buff 
for 6 hours (NOTE: After the buff expires they will have it again if they see a fairy again)
- They will have sparkles behind their back! (NOTE: They might dissappear, but don't worry they will re appear if you change
the lot or go in CAS) 
                                               -How to be a Fairy?-
So, to have a fairy you can use two methods:
- Create one from cas (They'll have -1 trait, becuase that space is going to be needed for the trait)
- Receive the fairies's blessing by "Pleading the fairies" from the "Fairies's tree"
                                          -What is the "Fairies's tree"-
A legend says that this tree was watered by a fairy queen's tears, and now is protected by fairies, who will 
curse or bless (your point of view) any sim who will plead to this tree by turning them into fairies as well. 
Why would the sim plead for a tree? Well they say that the tree brings a lot of fortune! Of course, this is all just
a legend... Or not...? Who knows!
                                         -What can you do with this tree?-
This tree has 2 interactions on it! :
- They can "Contemplate the tree", this will lead the sim to observe it.... Obviously!
- They can "Plead the tree" and this will bring the sim to transform after praying. 
BE CAREFUL THOUGH! A fairy cannot return into a human, so choose wisely...
